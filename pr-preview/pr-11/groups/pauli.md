title: Pauli Group
---

The Pauli group on one qubit is defined as $\mathcal{P}_1 := \{ i^n \sigma_j \mid n, j \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \}$.
The $n$-qubit Pauli group is defined by all of the tensor products of elements of $\mathcal{P}_1$.

$$
\mathcal{P}_n := \{ \bigotimes\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} X_i \mid X_i \in \mathcal{P}\_n \}
$$
